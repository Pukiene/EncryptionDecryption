The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption technique. It is a type of simple substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter with 
a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift number of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it
to communicate with his officials. 
Thus, to encrypt a given text we need an integer value, known as a shift which indicates the number of positions each letter of the text has been moved down.
